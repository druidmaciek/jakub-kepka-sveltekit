			The artist tries to focus on emotions, pouring the feelings he cannot cope with onto canvas.
			Each work, whether painting or fashion, deals with personal problems, and heavy emotions or
			traumas. The artist has a collection entitled "All These Emotions", "Deed and Punishment" and
			"Plasticity of Form". The collections successively tell about personal feelings. The series
			are not closed, as they are created together with the feelings and course of the artist's
			life. In connection with designing clothes, the artist creates photo sessions. Each fashion
			shoot is a personal vision. The general idea, the background, the scenario and all the clothes
			are sewn, constructed, stylized by the author. With the help of other artists or models I
			manage to translate my thoughts, in this case into fashion, as in painting. It is also
			important to note that each of the silhouettes is created with materials from second-hand
			shops.
